<p><strong>Readings.</strong> Chapter 3.3</p>
<p><strong>Q1.</strong>
Write a version of <tt class="docutils literal">tree_find</tt> from lecture (for finding keys among the
labels of a binary search tree) that is purely iterative and
does not use recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong>
Define a function <tt class="docutils literal">depth</tt> that, given  a Tree, <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt>, and a value, <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>,
finds the <em>depth</em> at which <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> appears as a label in the tree.
Depth here refers to distance from the root, <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt>.  The node <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt> itself is
at depth 0; its children are at depth 1, etc.  Assume that <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> appears at
most once in the tree.  Return <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> if it does not appear.</p>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong>
Generalize the binary search trees from lecture to search trees
with more than two children.  We can
define a <em>general search tree</em> as one whose labels are <em>lists</em> of keys
such that</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>A node whose label is None represents an empty collection.</li>
<li>Otherwise, there is at least one key in a node label and
the keys are sorted in ascending order.</li>
<li>A non-empty node with <em>N</em> keys has <em>N+1</em> children, which are
also general search trees.</li>
<li>If x is key #k in a node's label, then all keys in child #k are
less than x and all those in child #k+1 are greater than x.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Fill in the definition of <tt class="docutils literal">gen_tree_find</tt> in the skeleton to search for
a key in such a general search tree.</p>
<p><strong>Q4.</strong>
Write a higher-order function that generalizes memoization:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def memoize(func):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a function that takes the same arguments as 'func'
    and returns the same value, but with memoization.  That is, if
    f is the function returned by memoize(func), then f(v) returns
    func(v), but if f is called twice with the same arguments, v, it
    does not call func(v), but returns the previously returned value.
    We assume that 'func' is a pure function whose value depends only
    on the values of its arguments, and whose side-effects are irrelevant,
    and that the values of its argument, v, are of a type
    suitable for use as keys
    in a Python dictionary.&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>So, for example, if we define:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def fib(x):
    print(x)
    if x &lt;= 1:
         return 1
    else:
         return fib(x-2) + fib(x-1)

fib = memoize(fib)
</pre>
<p>and then call <tt class="docutils literal">fib(6)</tt>, we'd get the expected return value (13), but the
printed values would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, instead of the sequence
we would expect from the unmemoized <tt class="docutils literal">fib</tt>, which is 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, etc.</p>
<p>Your <tt class="docutils literal">memoize</tt> function should work with functions that take any
number of parameters.  <em>Reminder:</em> In Python, the syntax:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def f(*a): ...
</pre>
<p>allows <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> to take any number of parameters (0 or more),
setting <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> to a tuple containing them.  Likewise, if <tt class="docutils literal">g</tt> is a function
taking two parameters, then:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; g(1, 2)
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; v = (1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; g(*v)
42
</pre>
<p><strong>Q5.</strong>
Modify your solution to Q4 so that if the calculation of <tt class="docutils literal">func(v)</tt> for some
value of <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> causes a recursive call of <tt class="docutils literal">func(v)</tt> (that is, a call with the
same arguments, indicating an infinite loop), then the memoized function raises a <tt class="docutils literal">RuntimeError</tt>
exception.  Call the new version <tt class="docutils literal">checked_memoize</tt>.</p>
<p><strong>Q6.</strong>
Consider the following definition of <tt class="docutils literal">adjoin_set</tt>, adapted to the
binary search trees in this problem set, and <tt class="docutils literal">adjoin_all</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
empty_set = Tree(None)

def adjoin_set(S, v):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Assuming S is a binary search tree representing a set (no
    duplicate values), the binary search tree representing the set
    S U {v}.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    if S.label is None:
        return Tree(v, None, None)
    elif v &lt; S.label:
        return Tree(S.label, adjoin_set(S[0], v), S[1])
    elif v == S.label:
        return S
    else:
        return Tree(S.label, S[0], adjoin_set(S[1], v))

def adjoin_all(S, L):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;The result of adding all the elements of L to set S, in order.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    for v in L:
        S = adjoin_set(v)
    return S
</pre>
<p>Define two functions: <tt class="docutils literal">bad(N)</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">good(N)</tt> that each returns a sequence of
<tt class="docutils literal">N</tt> non-null integer values such that <tt class="docutils literal">tree_find(adjoin_all(empty_set, <span class="pre">bad(N)),</span> x)</tt> takes as long as possible for any given value <tt class="docutils literal">N</tt> and the worst
<tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">tree_find(adjoin_all(empty_set, <span class="pre">good(N)),</span> x)</tt> takes as little time as
possible for any given value <tt class="docutils literal">N</tt> and the worst <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>.</p>
<p><strong>Q7.</strong> [Extra for experts]
Write a function that returns the result of <em>removing</em> a value
from a binary search tree, if it is present (maintaining the search-tree
property, of course).  Returns the original tree if the value is not present.
The time spent should be proportional to the depth of the tree.
<em>Hint:</em> This is easy if the node whose label matches the value being
deleted contains at most one non-empty child.  The tricky
part is figuring out what to do when that node has two non-empty children.</p>
<p><strong>Q8.</strong> [Extra for experts] Define a function <tt class="docutils literal">preorder(T)</tt> on Trees
that returns an iterator  over the labels in T in preorder. That
is, it lists a node's label first, then those of its children
(recursively) in order.  (For this problem, there are no empty trees;
None is just a possible label value):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;&quot;&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; T = Tree(1, Tree(2, Tree(3, 4, 5), 6), 7, 8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(preorder(T))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
